    <h2>V0.0.1</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first release of KabaOS! This release is finally “good \
        enough” for the public to use even though this is far away form
        being usable in real situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        This version should only be used for testing purposes, as
        hardware support has not been fully tested and there are some known
        vulnerabilities running on untrusted hardware. If you do come by any
        errors please make a GitHub issue, or join #KabaOS in irc.ilita.i2p!
